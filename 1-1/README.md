### This is a generated wireframe cube.
Familiarize yourself with where and how the cube is created.  We will be changing this later.

Things to try:
* Change the color
* Change the dimensions
* Change the distance from the camera
* Change from wireframe to solid
* See if you can find where the cube is being rotated. Try changing the values and see what happens.
